		    <h1>Choosing the right OS</h1>
		    <p class="muted">30 May 2014</p>

		    ## The right OS for Development and general usage 

OS preference is something very personal and unique, and each person has its own taste and there are a vast number of good and usable OS in the market, Windows and Mac are good systems, each one have its own features and are both widely used. Choosing between Windows, Mac and Linux, might start on analyzing what you need in a computer. After being both a user of Windows and Linux in the past, and after using Mac also in a certain period I can say all 3 OSs are good, but eventually Linux would overcome the benefits of Windows and Mac, mainly due to the fact that Linux is free. Anyone can save at least 50 or 70 dollars in the act of buying a laptot or a desktop any  computer shipped with Linux (or even without any OS) ,without having need for a pre-paid OS installed by any manufacturer. 
This should be a default option in the market and at least a consumer right, as same as buying a product without a specific feature and thus paying less for the item.

Some positive aspects of Linux are specifically security and performance, it makes Linux a good choice in the brand range of Operating Systems.  Linux nowadays tends to be user-friendly and easy installable, its usability matured a lot across time in terms of Plug and Play capability and user-friendly Graphical User Interface(GUI) features. So nowadays it turned to be a good choice for any type of consumer, either if you're a developer or a regular user. Linux has an advanced File System, as it uses the iNode File structure, which has enhanced performance for indexed searching. Linux compared to Windows has a smaller, more compact set of System Calls which turns to be more concise, while Windows has a larger set of methods available on it's API,
 also Linux is smaller and has less lines of code.

As for Windows being the predominant OS for shipped out-of-the-box computers nowadays it is not surprising that this correlates to the actual taste of the consumer market. And that impacts on how the manufacturers should ship their pre-installed PCs. There are some available options of Manufacturers that sell laptops with pre-installed Linux versions, mainly HP, but they are quite too expensive as compared to windows models. For a consumer to have real choice and freedom in terms of consumer rights, the market laws would have to change, it would be necessary that manufacturers would guarantee the option of a PC with no pre-installed OS. As a consumer of laptops one would actually have to buy an expensive Linux pre-installed or pay for a Windows, one can say Windows is eventually cheap to the point that you don't bother on giving away 50 or 70 dollars. But still it turns to be like giving away 50 or 70 dollars in trade of nothing, or for something you won't actually use (if you're a Linux user), which tends to be contradictory in terms of consumer rights and freedom of choices in overall.
