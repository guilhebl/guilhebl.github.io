		    <h1>The right to buy a bare hardware laptop</h1>
		    <p class="muted">30 May 2014</p>

		    <h2>The unanswered question on consumer rights</h2>




<p>I found myself in need of a laptop and after being a user of both Windows and Linux in the past, and due to main factors but spethcifically security and performance, I choose Linux over Windows. After being a user of both I could finally decide and since Linux is easy installable and has matured a lot across time, also it has a more advanced File System and other utility tools. After being a Windows user for years after experimenting several vulnerability issues that eventually allowed malware and spyware software to install themselves on my laptop, I decided to switch definitely to Linux.</p>




<p>I was looking to buy a laptop that I wouldn't have to actually pay for the Pre-Installed Operating System. And thinking on simple terms, opting to buy a no-OS based laptop would be like opting for a Car without an air-conditioner or somewhat comparable add-on (As you can install yourself later not needing a pre-installed paid version).</p>




<p>After researching I found several Manufacturers like Dell and HP, they actually have options for Pre-Installed Linux out-of-the-box, and there are also several Linux devoted Laptop Retailers, but the prices in overall are way too expensive. It's probably cheaper to buy a Pre-installed Windows Laptop and then manually install the Linux OS from a USB stick or DVD erasing and replacing totally the installed Windows.</p>




<p>The thing is, as a consumer we should have the right to choose and customize our order, and eventually pay less in order to get only the most basic option: the bare hardware (mother-board, Processor, Chipset and components assembled together).
Since not opting for a Pre-installed OS would involve less efforts from the Manufacturer in terms of amount of software necessary to be installed.</p>




<p>As for Windows being the predominant OS for shipped out-of-the-box Laptops, there eventually might be a lack of option, for being a consumer, you would actually almost need to pay for a Windows laptop, even though being a Linux user, you're not even gonna use it, it's like giving away 50 or 70 dollars for nothing, which in terms of consumer rights tends to be archaic and unfair.</p>




<p>There are several factors which rolls behind the scenes putting pressure under the Windows adoption legacy. One is that government and economic interests of companies from the United States are being represented under the millions of Windows and Apple licenses across the World, and digging for a particular user or collecting user info for a particular machine Serial Id would eventually be easier on a Windows or MAC operating OS. Also tied interests of partnership and maintenance of the status quo are in play if analyzed carefully.</p>




<p>Although there is hope and positive expectations for the future, as society matures in terms of freedom of choice and consumer rights,  still there are necessary reforms to be done on the set of laws that govern consumer and organization based commerce, in order to accommodate the new digital landscape that emerged during the last decades and has rooted itself inside our culture.</p>
